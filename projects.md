# Research Projects

## [LIVEQuest]
[LIVEQuest] aims to develop a self-contained wearable Internet of things system for precision livestock agriculture. We focus on developing theoretical research into practice in the interdisciplinary area antennas, signal processing, spectrum sharing, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. This project brings together a mutually complementary and synergistic UK-China consortium, and provides the necessary financial support for this highly innovative, cross-disciplinary research and development project, aiming to address constraints of sustainable intensification of livestock production.


## [PetaBricks]
[PetaBricks] is a language and compiler where algorithmic choices are
exposed explicitly to create programs that define a search space of possible
algorithms.  The PetaBricks compiler then uses empirical autotuning to search
over these algorithms for an optimal version.
